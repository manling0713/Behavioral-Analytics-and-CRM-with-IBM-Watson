This project analyzes the IBM Watson Marketing Customer Value Dataset, focusing on car insurance dynamics and customers with expiring policies. The dataset has 9,134 rows and includes each customerâ€™s insurance policies, claims, and marketing interactions. Two key models were employed to derive insights from the dataset. 

First, a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) prediction model utilized a semi-log approach with variables such as employment status, policy details, and renew offers. It demonstrated effectiveness within the mid-range but tended to underestimate in extreme values. Insights revealed the significance of tailoring strategies for employed customers, focusing on those with a higher policy count, and refining renewal offers.

Second, a response rate prediction model, utilizing logistic regression, identified demographic and sales-related factors influencing customer response rates. Retired and highly educated customers responded more often, while certain offers and sales channels yielded lower response rates. Policy details were not predictive, emphasizing the role of demographics and sales channels in shaping response rates. Strategic recommendations include refining renewal offers and investing in specific sales channels and offers for optimal customer engagement.
